          <p1 style="width:60%">Morris Wong was born and raised in Palmerston North, and graduated with a BSc from Massey
            University in 1985. Following a post-graduate Diploma, he entered the School of Dentistry at
            Otago University, where he completed a BDS in 1990. His first year working was as Dental House
            Surgeon at Napier Hospital followed by locum dental positions in Private dental practice.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 1992 Morris travelled to Hong Kong, primarily to study language and to experience the Chinese culture. What started as a 6-month visit eventuated into a 7 year stay, where Morris worked in a private medical clinic as well as completing his Masters in Periodontology. Towards the end of this period Morris headed a dental team as part of a 10-week medical project in the North West of China.
            <br>
            <br>
            Morris returned to New Zealand in 2000 and gained his specialist registration as a Periodontist. The next 15 years were spent working in a group practice in Wellington specialising in Periodontics and Dental Implants, and building up the Lower Hutt practice. Currently Morris is working full time in Lower Hutt, and serves as visiting Periodontist to Hutt Hospital, where he works primarily with the combined Cleft Lip and Palate team.
            <br>
            <br>
            Morris practices all aspects of periodontics and dental implants, and is a member of the New Zealand Dental Association, New Zealand Society of Periodontology, Australia New Zealand Academy of Periodontology, Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons, American Academy of Periodontology, and the International Team for Implantology. Spare time is usually spent with family, involvement in the Anglican Chinese Church and writing periodontal reports. Current interests are skiing, snow boarding, tramping, running, basketball, and music. Morris is married, and has 3 children aged 16, 14 and 11. TO BE CONTINUED

                <!-- Periodontitis -->
                <p><b>Periodontitis: What is periodontal disease?</b></p>

                <p>Gum disease or periodontal disease is a bacterial infection caused by accumulation of dental plaque on the teeth. It is a disease that affects the gums and supporting bone surrounding the teeth. While periodontal disease does not cause pain it can lead to the deterioration of the supporting bone around teeth and allow teeth to become loose. The gums may become red, swollen and bleed easily, there may be a bad taste or smell from the gums.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pain is occasionally a problem if a periodontal abscess has formed around the root of a tooth.
                <br>
                <br>
                Periodontal disease is best treated under local anaesthetic by a periodontal surgeon. Your surgeon will endeavour to remove the cause of the problem by removing the plaque and bacteria from under your gums. It is essential for this treatment to be successful that you continue to have your teeth debrided of plaque and bacteria at regular intervals following the initial treatment.
            </p>

                <p><b>Dental Implants: What is a dental implant?</b></p>

                <p>Dental implants are used to restore the space left by missing teeth. They are a titanium replacement for the tooth root and they can support either a single tooth crown or sometimes 2 teeth bridge made by your dentist or prosthodontist. Dental implants can also be used to support a denture giving a very firm support to the denture and stopping any movement when eating or speaking. This can be provided with a single implant or more than one implant dependant on individual circumstance and preference.
                <br>
                <br>
                They are placed with a surgical procedure, usually under local anaesthetic, however we can offer sedation in some cases.
                <br>
                <br>
                There is occasionally the need to improve the bone where an implant is to be placed and this can be done with bone grafting. Sometimes this can be done at the time of placing the dental implant and sometimes it is necessary to do this as a separate procedure. Each case will be individually assessed and you will have opportunity to discuss this with your Periodontist before you begin treatment.
                <br>
                <br>
                Dentistry in NZ commonly uses a synthetic bone, your own bone or a mixture of the two. If this is something that applies in your case your Periodontist will explain your options to you.

                  <p><b>Gingival Grafting: What is gingival grafting?</b></p>

                  <p>There are many causes of recession of the gums. Gingival grafting is the procedure to move gum tissue from once site to another in the mouth, most commonly to improve appearance if significant recession has occurred. Gingival grafting is not always possible and careful consultation with a Periodontist is necessary to discuss the treatment options and outcomes. A Periodontist will be able to give you a realistic expectation of the outcome before your make a decision regarding this treatment or if this treatment will give the best result for your personal case.

                  <p>The band of tissue lying between the upper front teeth known as the ‘frenum’. You will find the frenum connecting the inside of the upper lip to the gum tissue between the roots of the upper front teeth or similarly between the centre of the inside of your lower lip and the centre of your lower gums. Normally the frenum blends into the gum tissue well above the level of the teeth. The procedure used to remove this tissue is known as a “frenectomy.” Frenectomy is used when there is a need to allow the lip more movement or if the frenum is causing an unwanted gap between the front teeth. Similarly, this can be done with the lower lip for the same reasons.

                  <p>Crown lengthening is a procedure used to take away bone and supporting tissue surrounding a tooth. This done to give a better aesthetic to front teeth and occasionally for functional reasons with molar teeth. After taking away a little bit of bone from around the tooth the gums with be placed back and moved into a new position so that more of the tooth can be seen and create a new lower “gum line”.

                  <p>Periocision is a procedure done after orthodontic treatment. The periodontist will removed some of the ligament connecting the tooth to the surrounding bone. This allows the tooth to settle into the position achieved through orthodontic treatment, and not return to the original position. This will help to maintain ‘straight’ teeth long after orthodontic treatment is completed.

                  <p>During the period where baby teeth are lost and adult teeth grown into place, occasionally a tooth will grow a little off course. This is most common with the canine teeth and often they need some help to come through. They are often high up behind the lip or lay across the palate. The periodontist will removed the gum and bone blocking the tooth from emerging in the right place and return the patient to the orthodontist to complete the movement of the tooth.

A periodontist will remove a small part of this and send it to a lab for testing. The lab will return a report with their findings and allow the periodontist to give diagnosis and the best advice of treatment for the problem.
